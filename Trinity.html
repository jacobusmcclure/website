<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<b href="https:/trininty.edu">Trinity University</b> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Trinity is a private liberal arts university with a student body a little over 2,000 strong. The university was founded in 1869, and is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. Trinity has a long history and a large endowment of $1.29 billion which helps provide scholarships and other great benefits for its students. </p>

<p>Trinity has a beautiful campus! From the many top-notch sports fields on lower campus, to the state of the art CSI building Trinity's campus is one of a kind. The beautiful red brick that that campus is comprised of stands out and sets the campus apart from its surroundings. The small campus is a community that houses most of the students and the strength of the community working toward the same goals is what is truly amazing about the campus and university.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the small class sizes as well as the expertise that the professors have in their respective fields. The connections and the prestige associated with Trinity have opened up many doors and allowed for great opportunities. We recently had the CEO of Valero present to my class and that was an amazing experience. Having one of the top CEO's in the world speak to my class opened my eyes to the realization that were all people and even the top business people in the world are just humans trying to make a difference in the world.</p>

<p>I chose to transfer to Trinity University because the combination of academic and athletic excellence. The high standards expected of students was appealing to me. I am a self motivated individual and found that the learning environment at Trinity has suited me well and fostered personal and academic growth.</p>
<p>I am majoring in accounting. The reason that I chose accounting was because I appreciate the structure that is present within the field. I like to follow the set rules and be able to solve problems in ways that are consistent and always the same. I do not like ambiguity when working through a process and with accounting that was cut out for the most part. </p>
